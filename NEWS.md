Well, according to our wonderful GitHub Milestones:
Version 1.0 is due out by February 27, 2015. This will be "the API release" with our goals being:
All of these working.
◦Economy API
◦Core API
◦Module loading
◦Ban API
◦Server Management API
◦Teleportation API
◦Formatting API
-- Also, according to GH, this is 33% complete. --
Version 1.1 ("the Core release") is due before April 6, 2015. However, this is by no means final and may change at a moment's notice. We aren't sure of all of the goals yet, but we defiantly need:
*The Core - Essential command and things like that.
*API: World Manipulation (like tools for making a WorldEdit like plugin, if you so desire) and any leftover bugs we might miss in 1.0 or extra patches/minor releases after that.
-- This is a HUGE project and we're still going full steam ahead, although we had the big inactivity period. Now, myself, along with @Exstar and now @WetSponge, we can pull off the most essential plugin in Sponge, with the core being possibly released soon after a Forge implementation of Sponge (i.e. the usable/runnable server) is released.

Consider that an official press release.
